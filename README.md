# malaria detection using CNN





------------------
## About the app
> This example is an image classification model, based on convolutional neural network architecture. The CNN has three hidden layers and has been trained on the following malaria parasite image dataset  <a href="https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/">National Library of Medicine</a>. The trained model achieved accuracy of more than 95% on the test set and its weights have been saved in the Models folder in the very useful HDF5 format. You may use your own saved trained model! Just make sure you put it in the Models folder and name it appropriately so that the flask app may call it.
